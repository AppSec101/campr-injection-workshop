exploit and fix workshop
	injection
		requirements
			basic knowledge of SQL and relational databases
			basic Java programming
			Java 1.6+
		flow
			split everyone into pairs (try to pair inexperienced with experienced people)
			introduce injection
				ask what injection vulnerabilities are?
				what's the worst that can happen?
				"Injection flaws occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter."
				SQL, LDAP, Xpath, or NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP Headers, program arguments
				examples: shellshock, wordpress sql injection (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jan/36)
			introduce cli java app that is vulnerable to sql injection
				? telnet/nc
					ncat -lktc 'java -jar target/injection-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar' $IP 8888
			have everyone run the app, explain interface
			explain how to exploit
			have everyone exploit the app
			demonstrate exploits
				' or 1=1 --comment
				for i in $(seq 0 10); do echo "' or 1=1 offset $i rows --comment" | java -jar injection.jar; done'"
			explain injection checklist (from OWASP page?)
				input sanitization (in as many layers as possible)
				delegate sql substitution to libraries
				whitelisting
			have everyone fix
			present fix
				download from ________
			try (and hopefully fail) to exploit again
				? have people 
			learn more
